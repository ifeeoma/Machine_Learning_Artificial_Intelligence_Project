This is a good readme file for us to note our process, pushes/pulls, and updates. I would suggest dating things as we complete them so we are all able to refer to a single document.

Example format for each item in README: NAME-DD/MM/YYYY-TIME(24 hours (ill adjust))-Comment on updata/change

-added csv files for each directory (25-61). Bugs in directory 29 in 4s and directory 45 in all time stamps. Added datafile2.py which converts nested json files to unpacked csv file. Aforementioned directory Whole...-int files were not converted.

updated the datafile2.py file in 4s directory. It is now better indexed in some of the for loops if the dimensions change. I confirmed that it still works as it did when i first converted the files by reconverting the file in the 25 directory. Since that did not change when I pushed both through, this siginified that the code, after I updated it, did not do anything different. That file needs to be copied into the other directories, which I will do now and push, but will not update the readme file with that progress.

Pushed combo files that include all three exposures titled sample#_combo...
The codes have been modified and distributed accross different repositories
